# Proxima Security Model

This document explains how Proxima isolates the people you invite from the rest of
your infrastructure, what you must do to **enforce** that isolation, and the broader
security posture of the application.

> **TL;DR** — Proxima gives every VM it creates a restrictive per-VM firewall that
> blocks the tenant from reaching your LAN, your other VMs, and the Proxmox host
> (while still allowing the internet). **Those rules only take effect once you enable
> the Proxmox cluster firewall.** For the strongest isolation, put tenant VMs on a
> dedicated VLAN/bridge (see [Gold-standard isolation](#gold-standard-isolation)).

## 1. The isolation goal

You want to share CPU/RAM/disk with friends and family so they can run their own VMs —
but they must **never** be able to reach:

- your other virtual machines on the cluster,
- the Proxmox host / management interface,
- anything else on your local network (NAS, router admin, IoT, other PCs).

There are two layers to this: **application authorization** (can a tenant see/control
*another tenant's* VM through Proxima?) and **network isolation** (can a tenant's VM
reach your infrastructure over the network?).

---

## 2. Application-layer authorization

This is enforced in code and is always on:

- Every per-VM API call resolves the guest through `getVmWithCap(vmId, user, cap)`, which
  returns it only if the caller holds the **capability** that route requires. A tenant
  cannot view, start, stop, delete, or open a console to a VM they have no access to.
- **Share a VM** grants another Proxima user access at one of three preset levels:
  **Viewer** (see the VM and its status), **Operator** (+ power actions and console), and
  **Manager** (+ config, resize, backups, IDE). No share level of any kind can delete,
  rebuild, migrate, re-share, or change passthrough — those stay with the owner and admins.
- VM listings return the VMs a caller owns **or has been shared** (admins see all), each row
  annotated with the caller's access level and capability set so the UI can gate controls.
- **Compute access windows** bound how long an invited person may use the cluster at all.
  The term is anchored at sign-up (or `never`); when it lapses the account is **suspended,
  not deleted** — VMs are stopped and every auth path refuses the session, including the
  console WebSocket, the IDE proxy, and both API-token families. Admins never expire.
- Resource **quotas** from the invite are enforced on every create; a tenant cannot
  exceed the CPU/RAM/disk you granted.
- The Proxmox **API token never leaves the backend** — tenants talk only to Proxima.
- VM `name`, `os` (ISO filename), and target `node` are strictly validated so a tenant
  cannot inject extra Proxmox parameters or alter API paths.

---

## 3. Network isolation (the important layer)

By default a Proxmox VM lands on your main bridge (e.g. `vmbr0`), which is your flat LAN —
**L2-adjacent to everything**. Proxima addresses this in two ways.

### 3a. Per-VM firewall (applied automatically)

When **Tenant network isolation** is enabled (Admin → Settings ▸ Proxmox tab, on by default), every VM
Proxima creates is configured with:

- `firewall=1` on its network device,
- guest firewall `enable=1`, `policy_in=DROP` (nothing on the LAN can initiate to the VM),
  `policy_out=ACCEPT` (further restricted below), `macfilter=1` (the VM can't spoof
  another machine's MAC), `dhcp=1` (so it can still lease an address), and `ndp=1` (IPv6
  neighbour discovery, needed for the guest to function on an IPv6-enabled bridge).
  `ipfilter` is left
  **off** — turning it on requires registering each VM's DHCP-assigned IP in an
  `ipfilter-net*` ipset, and without that Proxmox drops *all* of the VM's traffic.
- outbound firewall rules, evaluated top-to-bottom:
  1. `ACCEPT` → DNS (port 53) to your configured resolver(s) — or to **any** destination
     when none are set (see note), so tenant VMs always resolve names,
  2. `DROP` → `10.0.0.0/8`,
  3. `DROP` → `172.16.0.0/12`,
  4. `DROP` → `192.168.0.0/16`,
  5. (default `ACCEPT` → the public internet).

Net effect: the tenant VM can reach **the internet and DNS**, but **cannot reach any
RFC1918 address** — that includes your LAN, your other VMs, and the Proxmox host.

> **DNS servers (Admin → Settings → Network isolation).** Your resolver is often *not*
> your gateway — a Pi-hole/AdGuard box, a dedicated DNS server, or one on a separate
> VLAN. By default the isolation rules allow DNS to **any** destination so name
> resolution always works (the rest of RFC1918 stays blocked, so tenants still can't
> reach any other internal service). To tighten it, list your DNS server IP(s) in the
> **DNS servers** field and isolation will permit DNS *only* to those.

### 3b. You must enable the Proxmox cluster firewall

> **Per-VM firewall rules do nothing until the Proxmox *cluster* firewall is enabled.**
> Until then, VMs share your LAN with no isolation.

Admin → Settings shows whether isolation is **Enforced**. If it says *"Not enforced yet,"*
the cluster firewall is off. Enable it carefully:

**Safe enable (preserves your management access):**

1. Add a datacenter rule allowing your admin network to reach the host, **before** enabling
   the firewall, so you don't lock yourself out. On the Proxmox host shell:
   ```bash
   # allow your LAN admin subnet to the Proxmox web UI + SSH (adjust the CIDR)
   pvesh create /cluster/firewall/rules -type in -action ACCEPT -source 192.168.50.0/24 -dport 8006 -enable 1 -comment "mgmt web"
   pvesh create /cluster/firewall/rules -type in -action ACCEPT -source 192.168.50.0/24 -dport 22   -enable 1 -comment "mgmt ssh"
   ```
2. Enable the cluster firewall:
   ```bash
   pvesh set /cluster/firewall/options -enable 1
   ```
   Proxmox automatically permits cluster/corosync traffic between nodes, so quorum is not
   affected. Verify you still have web/SSH access immediately. To revert: `pvesh set /cluster/firewall/options -enable 0`.

Once enabled, Proxima's per-VM rules are enforced and the Settings page shows **Enforced**.

### Gold-standard isolation

Defense-in-depth beyond the firewall — put tenant VMs on a network that is isolated
**by construction**, so isolation doesn't depend on per-VM rules:

- **Dedicated VLAN / bridge with no route to your LAN.** Create a separate bridge (e.g.
  `vmbr1`) on a VLAN that your router NATs straight to the internet but gives **no route**
  to your management VLAN. Point Proxima's *default network bridge* (Admin → Settings) at it.
- **Proxmox SDN isolated VNet.** Create an SDN *Simple* zone + VNet with its own subnet and
  SNAT; tenant VMs get internet via NAT and are L2/L3-isolated from your management network.
  Set Proxima's default bridge to that VNet.

With either approach, even a misconfigured or disabled per-VM firewall cannot expose your
infrastructure, because the tenant network is physically/virtually separate.

### Containers

Proxima provisions both **QEMU VMs** and **LXC containers** (containers since v0.4.0). The
same tenant-isolation model applies to containers — the per-VM firewall, quotas, ownership
and share capabilities all treat them the same way — and LXC additionally benefits from
running **unprivileged**. Note that LXC has **no live migration** in the API-only model, so
the cluster balancer pins containers and node-drain lists them as blockers.

## 4. Other security considerations

| Area | Posture |
|------|---------|
| Proxmox API token | Stored AES-256-GCM encrypted in the DB; never sent to the browser. **Scope it down** — see below. |
| Secrets at rest | `proxmox_token_secret`, `jwt_secret`, and the SMTP/SSO secrets are encrypted with `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (AES-256-GCM, random 12-byte IV + auth tag). The key must be a **64-hex (32-byte)** string, and secret operations **fail closed** if it is missing (no static fallback). |
| Passwords | bcrypt (cost 12). Login runs bcrypt even for unknown emails to prevent timing-based account enumeration. |
| Sessions / JWT | 24h JWTs with a random `jti`, **verified with a pinned `HS256` algorithm**; every token is backed by a `Session` row, so logout / revocation is server-side. |
| Personal API tokens | The second auth path, for the public REST API (see [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md)). Tokens are `pm_` + CSPRNG random; **only an HMAC-SHA256 hash is stored**, so the plaintext is shown once and is unrecoverable. Each token carries its owner's identity and is subject to the same capability checks, quotas, and compute-access-window enforcement as a browser session; owners can revoke individual tokens. |
| Brute-force lockout | After `AUTH_LOCKOUT_MAX` (default 10) consecutive failed passwords an account is locked for `AUTH_LOCKOUT_MINUTES` (default 15), auto-unlocking. The locked response is identical to a normal failure (no enumeration), and admins are emailed when SMTP is configured. Complements the IP rate limiter (targeted vs. noisy-source protection). |
| Invites | 32-byte URL-safe random tokens, single-use (claimed atomically), with an expiry. |
| Input validation | All request bodies validated with Zod; Prisma parameterizes all queries. Request bodies are capped (1 MB). |
| Transport | Run Proxima behind HTTPS in production (reverse proxy). Set `verifySsl=true` once Proxmox has a valid cert — or keep verification **on** against a private CA via `PROXMOX_CA_CERT_FILE`/`PROXMOX_CA_CERT` (preferred over disabling it). |
| Browser headers | The frontend sends `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, HSTS, and a strict **nonce-based Content-Security-Policy** (`script-src 'self' 'nonce-…' 'strict-dynamic'`) so injected inline scripts can't execute. |
| CORS | Restricted to `FRONTEND_URL`. |
| Console tickets | One-time, short-lived Proxmox VNC tickets. The console WebSocket authenticates via the **httpOnly session cookie** (no token in the URL), checks `Origin` against `FRONTEND_URL`, and gates on the **`console` capability** — owner, admin, Operator and Manager shares pass; a Viewer share does not. |
| Rate limiting | Built-in `express-rate-limit` on `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, and public token lookups (invite lookup, backup downloads); the setup wizard's mutating steps are throttled too (env-tunable). A separate **write limiter covers all of `/api`**, skipping safe `GET`/`HEAD`/`OPTIONS`, so every mutating request is throttled (default 60 per 60 s per IP, `API_WRITE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` / `_WINDOW_MS`). Honors `trust proxy`. |
| Outbound requests (SSRF) | Admin-configured **notification webhooks** and **cloud-image URLs** are validated against a private-address blocklist (loopback, link-local / cloud-metadata `169.254.169.254`, RFC1918, CGNAT, IPv6 ULA / link-local, IPv4-mapped IPv6): shape-checked on save, DNS-resolved and re-checked immediately before the request, and redirects refused. Homelab installs that point at a LAN service can opt in with `ALLOW_PRIVATE_OUTBOUND_URLS=true` (scheme + no-credentials checks always stay enforced). |
| Metrics endpoint | `GET /metrics` is token-gated; in **production** it returns 404 unless `METRICS_TOKEN` is set — including for localhost, so there is no unauthenticated local scrape. Scrapers send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. |
| MFA-setup enforcement | Where an invite required two-step auth, six protected routers (`/api/vms`, `/api/templates`, `/api/admin`, `/api/proxmox`, `/api/users`, `/api/passthrough-requests`) block access until the user has actually enrolled a TOTP or passkey method. |
| Containers | Both images run with **all Linux capabilities dropped** and `no-new-privileges`; the frontend runs as a non-root user and the backend drops to the unprivileged `node` user after fixing data-volume ownership. |
| Audit log | VM lifecycle (create/delete/start/stop/restart/restore), auth events, and **account lockouts** are recorded with actor + client IP; admin-viewable at `/admin/audit`. |

### Proxima IDE (in-guest editor + AI agent)

The IDE is the one feature that reaches a guest **over the network** (`guest-ip:8080`) rather
than out-of-band through the Proxmox API, so it has its own guarantees (full model in
[`docs/proxima-ide.md`](docs/proxima-ide.md)):

| Area | Posture |
|------|---------|
| Editor transport | Reverse-proxied through the backend; every HTTP **and** WebSocket request is resolved through `getVmWithCap(vmId, user, 'ide')` and re-checked against the admin IDE policy. It is capability-gated, not owner-gated: a **Manager** share also holds `ide`, while Viewer and Operator shares do not. The proxy refuses loopback/link-local/metadata targets, so a spoofed guest-reported IP can't point it at the host. |
| Firewall pinhole | Reaching `code-server` needs one inbound hole in the guest's isolation firewall — added as a **managed, infra-scoped** ACCEPT via the Proxmox firewall API (like the isolation rules), scoped to `ide_ingress_cidr` (a wildcard `0.0.0.0/0` is rejected). The guest keeps `policy_in=DROP`, so **tenant-to-tenant isolation is unchanged** — only Proxima's address can reach the port. |
| LLM gateway | The in-guest AI agent authenticates with a **per-VM bearer token** (sha-256 hashed at rest) that re-checks ownership + policy live on every call. `resolveModelRoute` is the single allow-list choke point: a tenant can reach only admin-shared models, or their own BYO keys when enabled — never an un-shared model, even by editing the in-guest config. Admin upstream endpoints/keys never leave the server. |
| BYO-key SSRF | Tenants may only use OpenAI or the fixed preset OpenAI-compatible bases (OpenRouter, Groq) — a free-form custom base URL is **admin-only**. Tenant-supplied endpoints additionally go through the same outbound guard as webhooks (shape-check on save, DNS re-check at forward). Admins are exempt so they can source models from a **LAN** endpoint (e.g. a local Ollama). |
| Gateway limits | Body-capped (large chat contexts allowed but bounded) and rate-limited **per VM**, so a stolen or runaway token can't flood the upstream. |
| Base URL | The gateway URL handed to the guest comes from the operator-configured `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL` and **must be https** — an http URL gets 301'd, which breaks the agent's POST. Since v0.8.0 the configured value wins outright; deriving the scheme from forwarded headers is only a fallback for bare dev setups, having proved unreliable behind a proxy that rewrites `X-Forwarded-Proto`. |

### Recommended: scope the Proxmox API token

Proxima works with a `root@pam` token, but for least privilege create a dedicated user
(e.g. `proxima@pve`) with only the roles it needs (VM lifecycle, console, storage/audit,
firewall) on the relevant nodes/pool, and use that token instead. Proxima needs:
`VM.Allocate`, `VM.Config.*`, `VM.PowerMgmt`, `VM.Console`, `VM.Audit`, `Datastore.Audit`,
`Datastore.AllocateSpace`, and `Sys.Audit` (+ firewall management for isolation).

> Note: Proxmox API tokens default to **Privilege Separation ON**, which gives the token an
> empty permission set. Either disable privilege separation on the token or grant it a role
> explicitly (see the README).

### Production hardening checklist

- [ ] Serve frontend + API over **HTTPS** (reverse proxy / TLS).
- [ ] Set a strong, persistent `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and back it up (losing it makes encrypted config unreadable).
- [ ] Enable the **Proxmox cluster firewall** (§3b) — required for tenant isolation.
- [ ] Prefer a **dedicated tenant VLAN/SDN** (§ Gold-standard).
- [ ] Use a **least-privilege** Proxmox token, not `root@pam`.
- [x] **Rate limiting** on login/register/invite is **built in** (`express-rate-limit`). Behind a reverse proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY` to the trusted hop count so it keys on the real client IP.
- [x] **Per-account brute-force lockout** is built in (env-tunable; admin email alerts when SMTP is set).
- [x] **Browser security headers + nonce CSP** ship by default; pin `CSP_CONNECT_SRC` to your exact API origin to tighten `connect-src`.
- [x] **Hardened containers** (cap-drop, no-new-privileges, non-root) ship by default. The backend auto-`chown`s its data volume on start, so existing deployments need no manual migration.
- [x] **Outbound SSRF guards** on admin webhooks and cloud-image URLs ship by default (set `ALLOW_PRIVATE_OUTBOUND_URLS=true` only if you deliberately target a LAN service).
- [ ] Set **`METRICS_TOKEN`** if you scrape `/metrics` in production (otherwise it returns 404); or keep the scrape on localhost only.
- [ ] Prefer a private-CA `PROXMOX_CA_CERT_FILE` over `verifySsl=false` so the API token can't be MITM'd on an untrusted segment.
- [ ] Keep Proxmox VE patched (guest→host isolation ultimately depends on the hypervisor).
