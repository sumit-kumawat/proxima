/**
 * Per-request nonce CSP (Next 16 "proxy" — formerly middleware).
 *
 * `script-src 'nonce-…' 'strict-dynamic'` is the real XSS win: only scripts
 * carrying this request's nonce (and what they load) can run — inline-injected
 * script is dead even if a stored-XSS sink ever appears. Next injects the nonce
 * into its own framework/bundle <script> tags by parsing this header during SSR
 * (which is why nonce'd pages render dynamically).
 *
 * Deliberate relaxations so nothing breaks:
 *  - style-src allows 'unsafe-inline' (React sets inline style= attributes everywhere;
 *    style injection is far lower-risk than script injection).
 *  - connect-src is permissive (or operator-pinned via CSP_CONNECT_SRC) because the
 *    API + console WebSocket can live on a different origin (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL),
 *    unknown to this server process.
 *  - dev needs 'unsafe-eval' (React debug) + 'unsafe-inline' (Turbopack HMR).

  // `upgrade-insecure-requests` rewrites every http:// URL on the page to https://.
  // On an HTTPS deployment that is useful hardening; on a plain-HTTP one it is fatal
  // — the browser upgrades the page's OWN script/style/font URLs, nothing is
  // listening on :3000 over TLS, and every asset dies with ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR
  // before the app can render. So send it only when the browser is actually on HTTPS.
  //
  // Decided per request, from the scheme the browser used, in this order:
  //   1. X-Forwarded-Proto — set by any sane reverse proxy, and the only signal that
  //      is right regardless of how the image was built.
  //   2. NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL — a fallback for a direct-exposure deployment with no
  //      proxy. Note this is INLINED AT BUILD TIME by Next, so it reflects the build
  //      arg, not the current .env; passing it as a runtime env var does nothing.
  //      That is exactly why it must not be the primary signal: an operator who runs
  //      HTTPS but never set the build arg would get compose's `http://localhost:3000`
  //      default baked in and silently lose this header.
  //   3. The request's own scheme.

  // forging it only changes the forger's own page. It cannot weaken anyone else's.
