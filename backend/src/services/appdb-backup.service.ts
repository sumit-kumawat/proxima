/**
 * Scheduled backups of Proxima's OWN database (users, VM records, config,
 * encrypted secrets) — MateStates cover the guests, but until now the app DB
 * itself was only ever backed up by hand. A nightly `VACUUM INTO` writes a
 * consistent snapshot of the LIVE SQLite database (safe under concurrent
 * writers) into an admin-configured directory — point it at an off-host mount
 * (NFS/CIFS) so a dead host doesn't take the backups with it. Rolling
 * retention prunes old snapshots by filename (timestamps sort lexically).
 *
 * NOTE: the snapshot contains the same AES-256-GCM-encrypted secrets as the
 * live DB — restoring it needs the SAME `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Back that key up
 * separately (see DEPLOYMENT.md); a DB backup without the key can't decrypt
 * the Proxmox token, SMTP creds, or tenant AI keys.
