 * the guest for another minute or several — growing the disk, installing the
 * guest agent, docker/tailscale/the tenant's extras, applying the always-on base.
 * Stopping / restarting / deleting the VM in that window leaves a half-built box.
 *
 * So `deployFromTemplate` / `rebuildVm` flag the guest `deployState='deploying'`
 * (mirrors the IDE install lock — {@link ../services/ide-provision.service.ts}),
 * which the VM routes turn into a 409 on destructive actions. The lock clears the
 * moment a guest-agent `cloud-init status` probe reports the run finished, or —
 * as a fail-safe so a guest with no agent (nothing to probe) never stays locked
 * forever — after {@link DEPLOY_TIMEOUT_MS}. This module is side-effect-light and
 * unit-tested against a mocked agent.

 * Set the tenant's login password in-guest, via the guest agent, then destroy our
 * copy of it.
 *
 * This exists because the obvious alternative — handing the password to cloud-init
 * as `cipassword` — leaves its crypt hash in two places the tenant can read for the
 * life of the guest: the cloud-init seed drive (`/dev/sr0`, the 2026-07-18 pentest
 * finding) and the guest's own `/var/lib/cloud/instances/<id>/user-data.txt` cache.
 * Both were confirmed live on 2026-08-11, and ejecting the seed does NOT fix it
 * because the on-disk cache survives. The agent's set-user-password writes only to
 * /etc/shadow, so the credential never lands anywhere a tenant can read it back.
 *
 * Ordering matters: this runs only once cloud-init reports finished, because
 * `cc_users_groups` must have created the account first — setting a password for a
 * user that does not exist yet fails.
 *
 * Best-effort by design. A failure here must never hold the deploy lock: the guest
 * is otherwise usable, an SSH key may be the tenant's real credential anyway, and
 * the existing "reset password" flow (same agent call) is the recovery path. We keep
 * the encrypted value on a failure so a later poll can retry, and drop it once set.
