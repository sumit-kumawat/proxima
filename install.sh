# Proxima installer.
#
# Brings up a Proxima stack with Docker Compose: preflight checks, a generated
# ENCRYPTION_KEY, a correct .env for either an HTTP trial or a real HTTPS domain,
# and the build. It stops at the browser setup wizard on purpose — the Proxmox
# API token is entered there, never on a command line where it would land in
# shell history or a process list.
#
# This script is meant to be READ before it is run. It is deliberately not a
# `curl | sudo bash` one-liner: Proxima ends up holding a Proxmox token that is
# effectively root on your cluster, so piping it into a root shell is the wrong
# habit for exactly this software.
#
#   curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conzex/proxima/main/install.sh
#   less install.sh
#   bash install.sh
#
# Missing dependencies (Docker, Compose v2, git, curl, openssl) are detected and
# — with your explicit consent — installed for you. They are not optional:
# Proxima is a containerised application and will not run without them, so
# declining simply stops the install without changing anything on the machine.
#
# Usage:
#   bash install.sh                            # interactive
#   bash install.sh --local                    # HTTP on this machine's LAN address
#   bash install.sh --local --host 10.0.0.5    # HTTP on an address you choose
#   bash install.sh --domain proxima.example.com
#   bash install.sh --domain x --dir /opt/proxima --ref v0.8.6 --yes
#
# Flags:
#   --local            HTTP, no reverse proxy. For a trial on a trusted network.
#   --host <addr>      With --local: the address you will type in the browser.
#                      Defaults to this machine's primary LAN IP. Use "localhost"
#                      only if you browse from this same machine.
#   --domain <host>    One HTTPS origin you will front with a reverse proxy.
#   --dir <path>       Where to install (default: ./proxima, or the checkout you
#                      are already standing in).
#   --ref <git-ref>    Tag/branch to check out (default: newest vX.Y.Z tag).
#   --no-start         Write everything but do not build or start.
#   --yes, -y          Never prompt; requires --local or --domain. Also counts as
#                      consent to install any missing dependencies listed above.
#   --help, -h         This message.
