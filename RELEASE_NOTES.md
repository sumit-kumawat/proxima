## Security

- Cloud-init login passwords are no longer given to cloud-init. The crypt hash was written to the seed drive (`/dev/sr0`) and to the guest's `/var/lib/cloud` cache, both readable by the VM's own user for its lifetime. The password is now held encrypted until first boot, applied in-guest via the QEMU guest agent, then discarded. `cipassword` was removed from `setCloudInitConfig`'s signature.
- The Proxmox API token no longer appears in logged errors. Axios errors carry the request that produced them, including the `Authorization` header, so any Proxmox failure logged with the raw error object put cluster-root credentials into the logs. `config` and `request` are now sanitized at the client, on both the error and its response.
- Guests can be placed on a per-tenant VLAN. The per-VM firewall operates at L3 and above and could not prevent ARP poisoning, rogue DHCP, or IPv6 router advertisement between tenants sharing a bridge. Verified on a live cluster: cross-VLAN blocked at ARP resolution, same-VLAN control passes.
- Outbound DHCP server replies (`udp dport 68`) and IPv6 router advertisements are dropped per guest. Clients still obtain leases.
- The compute-access window is enforced on passkey and SSO login, not only password. All three paths share one refusal; a source-scan test fails if a new login path skips it.
- `testProxmoxConnection` rejects a token that authenticates but holds no permissions. A `--privsep 1` token answers `/version` and returns every node, so the previous check reported success. It now reads `/access/permissions` and names the missing privilege and the command that grants it.

## Fixes

- The default network bridge and default storage are applied to guests deployed from a template. A template deploy is a clone, so both were inherited from the template and the configured defaults never applied. Storage additionally reverted the migratability fix from 0.9.0 — new guests kept landing on node-local storage. Applied on deploy, duplicate and restore, preserving MAC, firewall flag and VLAN tag.
- A linked-clone template that is not on the configured storage is now full-cloned. Proxmox cannot place a linked clone on a different storage; the link is dropped rather than the setting, and the reason is logged.
- Cloud-image templates built by Proxima now include `qemu-guest-agent`. The importer converted the downloaded image to a template without booting it, so no package could be installed — and since login passwords are applied through the agent, those templates could not serve a password-only deploy. The build boots the image once, installs and verifies the agent, clears the cloud-init cache and build logs, then converts. A build without network access still produces a usable template, recorded as agentless and flagged in Template Store.
- `deploy.agent_missing` notification when a deploy's guest agent never responds. Previously the only signals were a log line and a tenant unable to log in.
- `GET /api/admin/storage-pinning` lists guests that cannot migrate, using Proxmox's own migration preflight.

## Modules

Self-hosted installs can add API routes and database tables without patching `app.ts`. A module is a directory exporting an Express router, enabled by name in `PROXIMA_MODULES` and served under `/api/ext/<name>`.

Modules supply a router rather than the application, so they cannot reorder middleware or replace the error handler. All modules mount under one reserved path segment and cannot shadow a built-in route. `requireAuth` is applied by default; opting out is logged by name at boot. Modules may own a Prisma schema and migrations, applied after core migrations.

With no module configured no import is attempted and no route is added. See `backend/src/modules/README.md`.

## Upgrading

No configuration changes required.

- Rebuild cloud-image templates to pick up the guest agent. Password-only deploys from templates built before this release produce machines their owner cannot log into. Template Store flags them.
- Guests created before this release keep their existing storage. `GET /api/admin/storage-pinning` lists any that cannot migrate as a result.
